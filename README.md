# toroidal-maze
This is a simple puzzle game where you control a sliding block and must reach a glowing exit by stopping on its tile. Written as a learning exercise in Java and OpenGL.

The game comes with 180 procedurally generated ([generator repository](https://github.com/DeathFuel/toroidal-maze-levelgen)) levels which greatly vary in difficulty. Each of them usually takes between 2 to 10 minutes to beat for the first time.
